# Getting Started 

## Test Environment  

The Multi-Touch (WacomMT_Scribble) demo sample is provided as a C++ application. To build this sample application, you will need Windows 7 and above with Visual Studio 2017 or above.

To test the application, a Wacom tablet driver must be installed and a touch-enabled Wacom tablet must be attached. All touch-enabled Wacom tablets supported by the Wacom driver are supported by this API. Get the driver that supports your device at: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers.

## Install the Wacom tablet driver and verify tablet operation  

In order to run a sample application, it is necessary to install a Wacom tablet driver, which installs the necessary runtime components that support Wintab and the Multi-Touch API. The driver can be found at: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers

Once the driver has installed, and you have rebooted your system, check your tablet driver installation by doing the following:

1. Attach a supported, touch-enabled Wacom tablet.
2. Open the Wacom Tablet Properties application (from the Start Menu, go to Wacom Tablet > Wacom Tablet Properties) to confirm your tablet is recognized.
3. Use the Pen and Touch to verify functionality.
4. If all of the above checks out, proceed to the next section to build/run the sample application.


## Build/run the sample application  

1. Open the WacomMT_Scribble.sln file in Visual Studio. The demo includes all SDK header files needed to build with. Other SDK components necessary to run the demo are installed with the tablet driver.
2. From the top menu, select Build > Build Solution.
3. Once built, start the solution from Visual Studio Local Windows Debugger.
4. As the app starts, there should be no warnings or errors. If you do see warnings/errors, be sure the driver is running with the attached, supported tablet.
5. About the application:  
	a. Finger data will show as circles of various colors with size information.  
	b. Pen strokes will appear in blue with pressure.  
	c. The "ESC" key will clear the windows of all input.  
	d. The "Options" menu item allows you to control how touch is handled by the application and get information about attached devices.
