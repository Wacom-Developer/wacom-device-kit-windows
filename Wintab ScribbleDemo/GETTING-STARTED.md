# Getting Started 

## Test environment

The Wintab demo samples have been provided as Win32 C++ applications. To build this sample application, you will need Windows 7 and above with Visual Studio 2017 or above.

To test the application, a Wacom tablet driver must be installed and a supported Wacom tablet must be attached. All Wacom tablets supported by the Wacom driver are supported by this API. Get the tablet driver that supports your device at: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers.

## Install the Wacom tablet driver and verify tablet operation
In order to run a sample application, it is necessary to install a Wacom tablet driver, which installs the necessary runtime components that support Wintab. The driver can be found at: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers.

Once the driver has installed, and you have rebooted your system, check your tablet driver installation by doing the following:

1. Attach a supported Wacom tablet. 
2. Either open the Wacom Tablet Properties app, or the Wacom Desktop Center to determine if your tablet is recognized by the driver.
3. Use a tablet pen to see if you can move the system cursor.
4. If all of the above checks out, proceed to the next section to build/run the sample application.

## Build/run the sample application

1. Open the ScribbleDemo.sln file in Visual Studio.  The demo includes all SDK header files needed to build with. Other SDK components necessary to run the demo are installed with the tablet driver.
2. Select CPU type x86.
3. Select Build > Rebuild Solution.
4. Once built, start the solution from Visual Studio Local Windows Debugger.
5. As the app starts, there should be no warnings. If you do see warnings, recheck to see whether the driver is running with the attached tablet as described above.
6. Depending on the tablet type, your monitor configuration, and where you started Visual Studio, you may need to move the app Window to an appropriate display.  For example, if using a Cintiq Pro, you would need to move the app window to that tabletâ€™s display.
7. Once on the appropriate display, your pen should be able to draw on the app.
