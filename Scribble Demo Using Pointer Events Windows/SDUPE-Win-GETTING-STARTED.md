# Getting Started 

## Test Environment
To test the webapp, ScribbleDemo HTML5 Pointer Events, a Wacom tablet driver must be installed and a supported Wacom tablet must be attached. All Wacom tablets supported by the Wacom driver are supported by this API. Get the driver that supports your device at: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers.


## Install the Wacom tablet driver and verify tablet operation
In order to run the sample application, it is necessary to install a Wacom tablet driver, which installs the necessary runtime components that support system APIs needed to supply pen, touch and mouse data for HTML5 Pointer Events. The tablet driver can be found at: https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers

Once the driver has installed, and you have rebooted your system, check your tablet driver installation by doing the following:

1. Attach a supported Wacom tablet.
2. Either open the Wacom Tablet Properties app, or the Wacom Desktop Center to determine if your tablet is recognized by the driver.
3. Use a tablet pen to see if you can move the system cursor
4. If your tablet supports touch, try moving the system cursor with your finger.
5. If all of the above checks out, you may now test the sample app as described in the next section.

## Testing the sample app
The HTML5 Pointer Events webapp sample does not need to be built. You can test the webapp by the following:

1. Open a browser (eg: Chrome, Internet Explorer)
2. Drag the HTML page onto the browser
3. Once the page loads, you should be able to immediately use your pen, finger or mouse to draw on the page canvas area

Alternately, you can simply double click on the HTML page and your default browser will open it automatically.
